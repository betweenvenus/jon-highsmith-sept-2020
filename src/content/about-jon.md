I’m a full-stack web developer from Atlanta.

I currently work at <a href="https://mopdog.com" target="blank">Mopdog Creative + Strategy</a>.

I like horror movies, fighting games, reality shows, manual transmissions, and 3D renders of skeletons.

Anyways, <a class="uh-oh">click here</a> to see the things I’m good at :-)
